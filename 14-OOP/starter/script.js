1. Use a constructor function to implement a Car. A car has a make and a speed property. The speed property is the current speed of the car in km/h;

3. Implement a 'brake' method that will decrease the car's speed by 5, and log the new speed to the console;
4. Create 2 car objects and experiment with calling 'accelerate' and 'brake' multiple times on each of them.
